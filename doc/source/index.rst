ROS integration
###############

This package defines several ROS interfaces for the :ref:`Object Recognition
Kitchen <orkcore:index>`. While ORK does not require ROS to run, several
input/output cells are specific to ROS.

- :ref:`ROS messages <msgs>`
- :ref:`Service for Object Info <srv>`
- :ref:`Actionlib Server <actionlib>`
- :ref:`Publishers and Subscribers <pubsub>`

There is also an :ref:`RViz plugin <orkrviz:rviz>`
